<!-- Hello all -- Here's the plan for witness/evidence:

There will be three pages. One for all witnesses, one for all evidence pieces and one that lists the days with evidence and witnesses for each. 

A user will click on a link from one of the daily cards, or we can provide links to use on section fronts or with stories. This would jump them to a page of all the witnesses, for example, with the card open for the selected witness. Other cards would be collapsed but shown in alphabetical order, with "click to open" text.

The page with all the days might feature our daily cards embed at the top.

Here is what's on evidence cards:
Title
Photo
Description 
Day
Witness(es) testifying to (if any)
Other connected evidence (if possible)

Here is what's on witness cards:
Name
Prosecution/defense
Role (i.e. medical examiner)
Photo (if any)
Description
Day(s) testified
Other witness connections (if possible)

Feel free to chime in if I am missing anything. See you all on Wednesday. -->
